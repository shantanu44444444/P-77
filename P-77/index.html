        <p id="P_2"> A console is the combination of a monitor and keyboard. It is a rudimentary interface in which the
            monitor provides the output and the keyboard is used for input. While any computer with a monitor and
            keyboard may be considered a console, the term most often refers to a system used to control one or more
            servers. </p>
